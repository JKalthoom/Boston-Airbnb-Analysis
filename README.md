## Boston Airbnb Analysis
Welcome to my very first Github project, in this project I will analyze the Boston Airbnb dataset to explore three questions related to business and real-world applications. By using data science techniques, I am aiming to uncover valuable insights from this data that can benefit both Airbnb hosts and guests.

## Project Motivation and Introduction <a name="motivation"></a>
As the sharing economy grows, platforms like Airbnb have become integral to the way we travel and experience new cities. Boston, renowned for its historical significance, esteemed universities, and lively cultural atmosphere, is a popular destination for tourists and business travelers alike. This makes it a perfect case study for examining the intricacies of short-term rental markets.
<br>
<br>
The primary motivation behind this project is to dive into the Boston Airbnb dataset to answer some critical questions that I am interested in and it can inform and enhance decision-making for hosts and guests. I aim to address the following questions:
<br>
1. How do various property attributes affect the listing price?
2. What is the average price of listings in each neighborhood?
3. ..

Through this analysis, I am hoping to provide actionable insights that can help hosts enhance their listings and improve the overall guest experience. Also, guests can use these findings to make more informed choices when selecting accommodations that best fit their needs and budget.
<br>
The data for this project is sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston/data"><strong>Kaggle</strong></a>, offering comprehensive data points of the Boston Airbnb market. By using this dataset, I aim to show the power of data science in addressing real-world challenges and driving better decision-making.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
<p>
  There should be no further installation to run my codes here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. But here are some of the libraries I used and the page to install them if any issue occurs.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Three notebooks are available on this page. Each notebook is related to one of the questions above, it will work through the data about the question shown by the notebook title. There will be comments to help you understand the code.

## How to Interact with your project <a name="interaction"></a>
The three notebooks should work separately, each of them will load the data, prepare and gather necessary columns, analyze and visualize the results, and provide answers

## Results <a name="results"></a>
My article that is published (here) contains the code's results.
